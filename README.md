# class_allocation
This project is for allocating students to class so that each class has:
- similar ratio of sex
- close average score
- close average score in all courses

# Current
Currently, we only support student scores in form of { A+,A,B+,B,C+,C }, only 3 courses

# TODO:
1. support student scores represented in percentage
2. support student scores with more coureses
